# Lantern glitch Don't Starve
This is a mod to restore the lantern glitch in the game Don't Starve, but still be compatible with Hamlet DLC.  
We made this mod for people who used this glitch for days and days to base-build, and for which fixing the glitch would mean losing lots of hours of work lighting the base. 

## Lantern glitch
If a lantern is dropped on the ground and switched on, and we disconnect, then at reconnection, it will light up all around it and it won't consume any fuel, but the sprite of the lantern will still stay as if the lantern was off.
